- navigate to localhost:4000
- enter url to shorten
- try out shortened url
- try out shortened URl that doesn't exist (observe server logs for helpful dev logs)
- try out valid base62 slug/shortened URL > than 12 characters, observe result/logs

# Run Tests
docker-compose exec web mix test

# Assumptions Made


## What I would have done given more time
- So many more tests!
  - more unit tests (as it is mostly just integration tests right now)
  - Tests for the context
- Mock out call to :inet.gethostbyname() so tests are isolated
- property based tests to really exercise parts of system that take input from outside world to hammer system and uncover new bugs
- Refactored Encoder and Decoder to be more resilient and handle more situations and return something other than just :ok, this was a compromise that would be good to talk about
- Would not have used remount
- Add Credo
- Actually run dialyzer to confirm my specs were correct
- Added docs where it makes sense and @doc false where it doesn't
- Coveralls to check test coverage
- Followed a style doc
- Done a code review with one or two colleagues
- Actual performance analysis with something like Benchee and make tweaks where needed
- used better form validation and tightened it down to only allow http(s) schemes (as is only errors out)
